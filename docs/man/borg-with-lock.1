.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
borg [common options] with\-lock [options] REPOSITORY COMMAND [ARGS...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
This command runs a user\-specified command while the repository lock is held.
.sp
It will first try to acquire the lock (make sure that no other operation, in
case of \fB\-\-shared\fP: no other changing operation, is running in the repo),
then execute the given command as a subprocess and wait for its termination,
release the lock and return the user command\(aqs return code as borg\(aqs return code.
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
If you copy a repository with the lock held (a \fB\-\-shared\fP lock is sufficient
for that), the lock will be present in the copy. Thus, before using borg
on the copy from a different host, you need to use "borg break\-lock"
on the copied repository, because Borg is cautious and does not
automatically remove stale locks made by a different host.
